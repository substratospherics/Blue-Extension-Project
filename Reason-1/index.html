      <h3>
        Blue pigments, such as anthocyanins and delphinidins, are less frequent
        in plants and animals than other colors because they are more difficult
        to produce and are not as important for survival and reproduction.
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          These blue pigments are often produced as a secondary metabolite,
          which means they are not necessary for basic metabolic processes and
          may have developed for specific purposes such as enticing pollinators
          or repelling herbivores. Furthermore, rather than being a constant
          feature, blue pigments are frequently created in reaction to
          environmental stresses like UV radiation.
        </li>
        <li>
          In contrast, pigments such as chlorophyll in plants and carotenoids in
          animals are necessary for photosynthesis and visual communication,
          respectively, and are therefore more commonly found.
        </li>
        <li>
          To elaborate, chlorophyll, the green pigment found in plants, is
          required for photosynthesis, the process by which plants convert light
          energy into chemical energy in the form of glucose. Chlorophyll
          absorbs light primarily in the blue and red spectrums, reflecting
          green light and giving plants their distinctive color. Chlorophyll
          pigments are found in chloroplasts, which are
          photosynthesis-specialized organelles found in plant cells. Because
          photosynthesis is necessary for plant survival and growth, chlorophyll
          can be found in almost all plants.
        </li>
        <li>
          Carotenoids, on the other hand, are pigments found in animals,
          specifically in their skin, feathers, and scales. They are responsible
          for many animals' yellow, orange, and red colors. Carotenoids do not
          participate in photosynthesis, but they do play a role in visual
          communication in animals, such as attracting mates, defending
          territory, and camouflaging. Carotenoids are also beneficial to
          animals because they act as antioxidants, preventing cell damage by
          neutralizing harmful molecules known as free radicals.
        </li>
        <li>
          As a result, chlorophyll and carotenoids are both important pigments
          for their respective organisms. Chlorophyll is required for
          photosynthesis, which is necessary for plant survival and growth,
          whereas carotenoids are required for visual communication and have
          antioxidant properties. As a result, they are more common than blue
          pigments.
