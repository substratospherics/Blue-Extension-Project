          Blue structural coloration, which is the result of light scattering,
          is rarer in nature than pigmentation-based coloration.
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Some animals and plants use structural coloration to create
            different colors by changing how light reflects off of them. This
            differs from pigmentation-based coloration, which occurs when an
            animal or plant has a particular color due to pigments (such as
            paint) in its skin or leaves.
          </li>
          <li>
            Structural coloration is a type of coloration that is produced by
            the physical structure of an organism, rather than by pigments. Blue
            structural coloration in particular is rare in nature because it
            requires specific structural arrangements to produce. Pigment-based
            coloration, on the other hand, is much more common and is produced
            by pigments that absorb certain wavelengths of light and reflect
            others. This means that blue structural coloration is less
            frequently found in nature than pigmentation-based coloration
            because it is more difficult to produce and maintain.
          </li>
          <li>
            The blue color of certain butterfly wings is an example of
            structural coloration. The blue color is caused by how tiny
            structures on the wing surface scatter blue light in a specific way,
            not by pigments.
          </li>
          <li>
            Because structural coloration is more difficult to produce, it is
            more rare in nature than pigmentation-based coloration. The
            development of complex structures, such as the scales of a butterfly
            wing, is often required to create structural coloration, whereas
            pigmentation-based coloration can be created simply by adding
            pigments.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pigmentation coloration can be thought of as painting a wall with
            different colors of paint, where the color comes from pigments
            present in the paint. Structural coloration, on the other hand, is
            similar to building a wall with variously shaped bricks that are
            arranged in a specific pattern to create different colors. The color
            in this case comes from the way light interacts with the structure
            of the bricks. Structural coloration is a rare and more complex
            process than pigmentation as it involves the manipulation of the
            physical structure to produce color, rather than relying on
            pigments.
