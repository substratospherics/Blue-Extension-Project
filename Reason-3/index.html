          Many blue animals have structural features that give off a blue
          iridescence rather than being truly blue.
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Many animals that appear blue, such as birds, fish, and insects,
            actually have structural features that convey a blue iridescence
            rather than being truly blue. This is referred to as "structural
            coloration." Structural coloration is caused by an object's physical
            properties rather than pigments, which are the basis of pigmentary
            coloration.
          </li>
          <li>
            Iridescence is when an object appears to change color when viewed
            from different angles. It's like when a soap bubble changes color in
            the light or when a CD reflects different colors in the light.
          </li>
          <li>
            The blue color in blue structural coloration is caused by how light
            interacts with the surface of the animal's feathers, scales, or
            exoskeleton. These structures' surfaces are made up of layers of
            cells or scales stacked in such a way that they interfere with light
            in a specific way. Because of this interference, certain wavelengths
            of light are reflected more strongly than others, resulting in a
            blue iridescence.
          </li>
          <li>
            So, these animals have special pigments or structures in their
            feathers, scales, or wings that make them look blue, but this color
            is not coming from a blue pigment, it's coming from the way the
            light is reflecting off of these special structures. The color
            changes as the angle of light or the angle you're looking changes.
          </li>
          <li>
            The structural characteristics that produce this blue iridescence
            can be quite complex. The interaction of light with the microscopic
            structure of some birds' feathers, for example, produces the blue
            color. The feathers of these birds are made up of layers that are
            stacked on top of one another, each with a different refractive
            index. When light strikes the feather, it interacts with these
            layers, causing certain wavelengths of light to be reflected more
            strongly than others and giving the feather its blue color.
          </li>
          <li>
            The interaction of light with the surface of other animals' scales
            or exoskeletons produces the blue color. The surface of these scales
            or exoskeletons has a series of grooves or ridges that diffract
            light in such a way that certain wavelengths of light are reflected
            more strongly than others, resulting in the blue color.
          </li>
          <li>
            It is important to note that the iridescent blue color is a result
            of the way light interacts with these structural features, and that
            it can change depending on the angle of the light, and angle of
            observation.
