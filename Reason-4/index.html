        <h3>Blue is less common in minerals and crystals than other colors.</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Blue is less common in minerals and crystals than other colors
            because minerals and crystals with the right chemical composition
            and structure to produce blue are more rare.
          </li>
          <li>
            Minerals and crystals are composed of various elements and
            compounds, and the color they exhibit is frequently determined by
            the specific chemical composition and the arrangement of the atoms
            in the crystal structure. Different colors are produced by different
            types of electron transitions and light wave absorption. Blue color
            is produced by a specific set of conditions, such as a specific type
            of crystal structure and the presence of specific elements or
            impurities.
          </li>
          <li>
            To put it simply, minerals and crystals are like puzzle pieces; they
            must have the correct shape and number of pieces in order to form a
            specific color, in this case blue. Other colors, such as red,
            yellow, and green, are more common and easier to form because they
            do not necessitate the same conditions as blue.
          </li>
          <li>
            To elaborate, the presence of specific elements, the precise
            arrangement of atoms, and the precise size and shape of the crystal
            are all required for blue structural coloration in minerals and
            crystals. The mineral lazurite, for example, is known for its deep
            blue color, which is caused by the presence of sulfur and titanium
            atoms arranged in a specific pattern. Similarly, the presence of
            titanium and iron atoms in a specific crystal structure gives blue
            sapphires their color. The precise conditions required for these
            structural colorations to occur make blue minerals and crystals more
            rare.
